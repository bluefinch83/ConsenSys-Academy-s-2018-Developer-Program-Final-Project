First off, it's important to keep in mind that no ETH is being sent to or by the contract, so a good number of common securty issues aren't an issue. Also, since betting isn't involved in contract, there would be no material gain for messing with the game. People may still do it, however, there's little reason to. I ran my tests and made sure that there were no logic bugs. I also tried to think through possible recursive calls and prevent them. For example, in the fuction new2playergame, the game number only increases and the function only emits that a new game has started after all the other code has run. If this function fails halfway through, game number won't increase, and recalling the function will just overwrite the first function's work. I was also very aware of of the potential for interger overflow. Every time I used an interger besides the game number, I made sure to protect against overflow issues. This also helps protect against poison data and DDOS attacks, since most of the user inputs are intergers. I've done my best to try and avoid common issues. 

Note: Since the Client Side code is only there for testing, I didn't make sure that it was safe. However, I did my best when writting it to make good code.
